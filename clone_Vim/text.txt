1 I got guns in my head and they won'  go
2 Spirits in my head and they won't go
3 I got guns in my head and they won't go
4 Spirits in my head and they won't
5 I been looking at the stars tonight
6 And I think oh, how I miss that bright sun
7 I'll be a dreamer 'til the day I die
8 But they say oh, how the good die young
9 But we're all strange


And maybe we
 don't wanna change
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go

 UCIA DIVINA DE MI ALMA te amo infinito

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
But the gun still rattles
The gun still rattles, oh
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I spent a lot of nights on the run
And I think oh, like I'm lost and can't be found
I'm just waiting for my day to come
And I think oh, I don't wanna let you down
'Cause something inside has changed
And maybe we don't wanna stay the same
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
20eI got guns in my head and they won't go
19Spirits in my head and they won't go
18But the gun still rattles
17The gun still rattles, oh
16But the gun still rattles
15The gun still rattles, oh
14And I don't want a never ending life
13I just want to be alive while I'm here
12And I don't want a never ending life
11I just want to be alive while I'm here
10And I don't want to see another night
9Lost inside a lonely life while I'm here
8I got guns in my head and they won't go
7Spirits in my head and they won't go
6I got guns in my head and they won't go
5Spirits in my head and they won't go
4But the gun still rattles
3The gun still rattles, oh
2But the gun still rattles
1The gun still rattles, oh
